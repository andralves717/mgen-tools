# usage: last-flow-result [FILE...]
#
# The result messages need to mention "flow" in field 4, and to provide the
# flow id in field 5.  Thus the tool is compatible with the output of, e.g.,
# packet-dup-loss-analyzer, packet-loss-filter, and packet-reorder-filter.

# save the last mgen-tools result message per flow
$4 ~ /flow/ && $5 ~ /^[0-9]+$/ {
  results[$5] = $0
}

# print last mgen-tools result message per flow
END {
  for (i in results) {
    print results[i]
  }
