Tools to analze MGEN logfiles:

ignore-startup_phase      remove the first n receive-events from every flow
ignore-sequence_numbers   keep packets with sequence numbers in [low,high]
packet-loss-filter        print a message for lost or too late packets
packet-reorder-filter     print a message for reordered packets
packet-loss-analyzer      count number of received packets and print statistics
                          for each flow and a summary
packet-dup-loss-analyzer  print lost or duplicated packets

ignore-startup_phase and ignore-sequence_numbers expect the option '-v' to set
variables.
