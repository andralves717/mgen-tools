Tools to analze MGEN logfiles:

average-bandwidth         compute overall average bandwidth and other statistics
flow-info-csv             create CSV table (with header) of info about the
                          streams included in the log like src/dst IPs, creates
                          lists of values for more dynamic streams (or multiply
                          used stream IDs)
flow-latency-analyzer     calculate min, max and average latency of flows
ignore-sequence_numbers   keep packets with sequence numbers in [low,high]
ignore-startup_phase      remove the first n receive events from every flow
packet-dup-loss-analyzer  print lost or duplicated packets
packet-loss-analyzer      count number of received packets and print statistics
                          for each flow and a summary
packet-loss-filter        print a message for lost or too late packets
packet-reorder-filter     print a message for reordered packets
recv-to-csv               create CSV table (with header) of receive events
                          (time stamps are converted into seconds)

Some tools support setting variables via Awk option "-v VARIABLE=VALUE":
 - flow-info-csv           uses the variable "sep" to specify the separator
                           string (default: sep=,) and the list seperator for
                           the potential lists of values (default: lstsep= )
 - ignore-sequence_numbers uses the variables "low" and "high" to ignore receive
                           events with sequence numbers outside the closed
                           interval [low, high] (defaults: low=0, high=infinity)
 - ignore-startup_phase    uses the variable "skip" to ignore the first skip+1
                           receive events per flow (default: skip=92)
 - recv-to-csv             uses the variable "sep" to specify the separator
                           string (default: sep=,)

Some tools read all input before any output, others produce output immediately:
 - Immediate output:
   - ignore-sequence_numbers
   - ignore-startup_phase
   - packet-loss-filter
   - packet-reorder-filter
   - recv-to-csv
 - Output generation after reading input completely:
   - average-bandwidth
   - flow-info-csv
   - flow-latency-analyzer
   - packet-dup-loss-analyzer
   - packet-loss-analyzer
